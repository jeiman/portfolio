                        <h2>Side Note</h2>

                        <p>My goal was and still is pretty simple &#8212; to change the world. It all started back in my college days when my first computer science module for the year involved me designing a simple HTML webpage for an assignment. From then on I realised that there's a lot of potential in creating content using the web technologies that were available at the time and more to come in the future (NodeJS, AngularJS that are available now). Hence, I decided to pursue my passion in the field of web development. I founded up my very own freelance company, Techsols Enterprise in which I provide web and IT solutions to clients in need of my service. I have designed several websites for clients since then.
                            <br>
                            <br> I get this zest-feeling when I start coding, knowing that I could turn a simple product into a marketable content for consumers to use. Furthermore, once you finish a project and feel great about it, you know that you can achieve more than you've done in the past. All of which by utilising the web technologies that are currently in the market.</p>

                <img class="img-responsive singam" src="img/dashboard.png" alt="dashboard">
            </div>
            <p>I recently designed a dashboard monitoring system using JSP (with HTML5 elements for flat and responsive design elements) and SQL to monitor live orders and transactions coming through the system for a telecommunications firm.</p>
            
            
            
            <h2>Why Web Apps over Mobile Apps?</h2>

            <p>Web applications are popular due to the ubiquity of web browsers, and the convenience of using a web browser as a client. The ability to update and maintain web applications without distributing and installing software on potentially thousands of client computers is a key reason for their popularity, as is the inherent support for cross-platform compatibility. Your data is safe and secure on encrypted servers. You'll never have to ask "Is it compatible with my device?". Your data is backed up daily. You can work from home, work or on the road; anywhere that has internet access. What more can you ever ask for? <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i><br><br>
There are tones of web frameworks out there that has pushed the boundaries of a mobile space can do. Django, NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, Symfony, AngularJS all of which can do wonders for you.</p>

            <p>Of course, that's not to rule out mobile apps as they are as equally as robust and powerful in lieu to web apps. You want mobility, on the fly updates. Maybe there're some of us that probably dont have a strong Java or Objective C/Swift skillset(as Android apps are built of Java/iOS apps are built of Objective C/Swift). Hence, there's a <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">hybrid mobile app framework </a> out there that utilises HTML5 and JavaScript as a base language to develop rich, robust mobile applications. Develop once and deploy it to both platforms, Android and iOS. Simple as that! And the best of all is that you can code it in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript &#8212; the building blocks of the web.</p>
            
            <p>Bottom line, I love web apps. I believe there's a lot to give in this space as they are only a handful of products currently in the market and there's still room for improvement for a product that can truly revolutionize and enhance the way we conduct our day to day activities.<br><br>
                The technology industry is moving at a very fast pace and we as developers need to be able to think outside of the box. Creating innovative, user-friendly and essential products can help both our consumers and the company to produce better results.</p-->
